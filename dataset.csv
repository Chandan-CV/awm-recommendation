Privilege could also mean that one has the means/ resources, freedom & opporunity to live life on their terms regardless of the family that they’re born into. The former gets it handed on a silver platter, whereas the latter, one has to make it happen.","Grew up in a typical middle-class, South Indian (Kannadiga) family with solid values. My big brother & I were encouraged to have an opinion, question things & not blindly follow the herd.   Our mother always said: “It is alright if you can’t help someone, but never harm anyone.” Our father was big on honesty & integrity.   Being the youngest at home, I’ve been on the receiving end of a lot of love, affection & care. There were a few issues in my household like most families do but I wouldn’t change a thing because they’ve made me the woman that I am today.  I was heavily into sports, extra-curriculars along with maintaining good grades till Class 10.

I come from family of academics and researchers. Both my grandfather and father epitomised simple living and high thinking. My grandparents were often ahead of their time. I grew up watching my parents being so caring and considerate towards each other, which often led our relatives and cousins to idolise them as the ‘perfect couple’. I grew up surrounded by love and encouragement but things changed a little when my father passed away when I was 20 years old. Despite this loss, my mother made sure my sibling and I continued to receive the best. We also place a high value on our culture & traditions, gathering together for family gatherings and festivals to celebrate our shared values. I am also fortunate to have incredible friends since childhood who have stood with me through thick and thin.
