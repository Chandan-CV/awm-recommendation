16,Female,33,Bangalore,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yklo3yq1lsQ,"I define privilege to be having surrounded by a loving family and friends, having control over your life doing things that you would love to and not being dominated by someone else. In my life, I am really blessed to have all these. My family loves me, I had good network of friends at all phases of my life. It was never a struggle to make good friends. I have now reached that stage of life where I never have to depend on anyone to decide what I want and what I don't want in my life (which was not the case earlier). I have seen too much of domination in my family by the male members on their female counterparts. Hence I feel my life itself is a privileged one to have not had to undergo all those.","Was indeed a rollercoaster ride with equal share of joy and struggles. I am born and brought up in bangalore in a patriarchal orthodox joint family. I was the youngest one amongst all my cousins and a bit pampered as well by them. Among everything else, all that I can remember from childhood are those days spent with them. I don't remember a trace of how my parents looked after me. All I can recollect are those how my cousins took care of me. But suddenly we all had to seperate due to family partition and everyone moved miles apart. This took a huge toll on my mental and physical health and impacted my studies and early career. Hence I value family and people a lot in my life (need not always be the family bonded by blood). After that I grew up independently, met many people outside my circle and learnt about life from them, which made me develop the attitude of acceptance of beliefs and practices different from that of mine. Coz of this I also became a black sheep in my family for questioning certain practices. And today I stand strong being authentic with no regrets.",Never married,No,Under 12 Lakhs,"Corporate law and compliance professional currently working in social sector, Co-founder of an NGO, Law enthusiast and will soon be venturing into sustainability practices.",Mount Carmel college,Masters,"I am wanderlust, who loves to travel to mountains (though I have cardio tolerance of that of a fat cat). Simple living is my mantra for life and off late I have been exploring options to practice conscious living by trying minimalism, being mindful about by shopping choices, thinking and breathing sustainability. I care a lot for the place I live. 

I define myself as an Ambivert. I do have a active social life but at the same time I isolate myself if I don't find the vibe that connects with mine. One can see me on weekends either volunteering, attending some random event (which bangalore is famous for) or having a long walk alone in a park. 

I am spiritually inclined. I meditate a lot and have my own practices and have started learning more about energy management through reiki, pranic, sound bowls etc (still ameture). I believe in contributing to the universal peace. Though I follow hinduism, I believe in one universal energy. Would always love to explore other religions, read their scriptures and understand their practices.

My liking for photography began with sketching and painting back in school, but my impossibility to stay put at one place to paint something as I grew up and my increasing love for travel eventually led me to paint with light by capturing moments through the camera lens! I even ended up doing 25 events as a side gig in the past, though I've since taken a break from that. These days I'm more into travel and street photography, constantly seeking new perspectives and stories to tell.

Trains interest me to no end (I'm your Sheldon Cooper Lite). I'm the go to person in my circle and extended circle if someone wants to know anything about trains starting from the complex technical railway operations to as simple as booking tickets. I'm also an Aviation geek.

During the pandemic, I picked up cycling to manage my weight (WFH woes!), and it's turned into a love affair that's lasted three years and clearing more and more miles. I hate going to the gym and I'm an outdoorsy person, you should have guessed it by now. Can go upto 70 KM in one shot on flat terrains and 50 KM is the max I could do in the up and down gradients of Bangalore. My weekend mornings are usually either dedicated to this activity or going for a photowalk.

Long walks are another favorite of mine, and leave me in a terrace and I would stargaze away all night – my way of finding calmness.

I'm a beach lover, yet I'm equally drawn to the thrill of trekking and hiking through rugged trails. During school, I was always active, ranking number two in athletics for four straight years and playing cricket, volleyball, and kho-kho.

Reading was a huge part of my life in college, but I fell out of the habit after graduating. Last year, I bought myself a Kindle to rekindle that passion, and it's been a decent journey back into the world of books. Wish to do better here.

Introduce me to good music and I'll forever be indebted to you!

Humor type: Sarcastic, deadpan, and dark. 

And that's a little about me.

I have been privileged to have access to good education, of having parents who were teachers which gave me access to the right education and values, who allowed me to pursue my goals. A creative mind and a healthy functional body!","Born in 'God's Own Country' and raised in the Middle East. My teenage years were spent in boarding schools. In short the definition of 'home' does not imply a place or a set of people for me. Home is where there's good food, friends, and books (and hopefully soon - my woman). My family is mom, dad and younger sister.

Growing up we did not have a TV at home (nothing to do with being poor :p ), this meant that ‘entertainment’ — for me — came in the form of playing outdoors, reading (no, devouring) books, magazines, anything I could lay my hands on. We have the entire set of Encyclopedia Britannica at home, and I read those once I ran out of reader’s Digests. 😂 

When I turned 13, my parents sent me to a boarding school and I moved from the Middle East to Kerala. Since then I’ve been in hostels and boarding, visiting home during the annual vacation. My grandfather was my local guardian during this time - and I have had the privilege of learning some amazing and fundamental values from my grandparents. I had an experience of the farm-life during this time, in close proximity with a cow, chickens, dogs, and learnings in the art of crop planting and harvesting. 

And although at the time, I was more interested in electronics and gadgets, the desire for being immersed in nature has stayed on. I hope that one day I can go back to this farm and continue this legacy.

Began my career as an Investment Banker, two years in, I realized I was more passionate about words on paper than numbers on Excel sheets. Experimented with many roles until I eventually settled for Marketing and Content. (happy to share more on this if we connect 😀",Madras Christian College,Undergraduate,"since the word #Traveller has been used and abused a lot — I don’t wish to call myself one, but I guess you should know that I am a sucker for long trips. Driving, traveling, and camping are things I enjoy — guilty pleasures I indulge in unabashedly. I would appreciate it if my partner could relate to this. (but this is not a deal-breaker for me, and this is not a must-have).

From the vantage point of a romantic relationship, I believe the dynamics work best when the man and woman ‘complement’ each other, not compete with each other, and definitely not complete each other. I am a wholesome, complete individual in myself, it would be foolish to assume that someone else could complete me. At the same time, I have room for growth. A partner in this growth who supports, challenges, and inspires would be much appreciated.

I am looking for someone who acknowledges God / The Universe / a Higher Power. So that would be a ‘no’ to atheists. I respect atheism, I don’t accept it. 😇 #dealbreaker

In terms of lifestyle, I am okay if my partner drinks/smokes (as mature individuals, if you do not think it’s wrong then neither do I)
But it will have to be a hard pass if you smoke-up / use drugs.

I’m not too keen on having kids. But I am open to the idea. The reason I’m not keen on having a baby is that I do not feel a natural inclination to be a father or ‘procreate’ as some of us do. Perhaps I still haven’t figured out my ‘why’... or perhaps I haven’t met the woman who would arouse that side of me. Who knows — once I experience companionship and love with a certain someone, and if she wants to have kids, I may also feel the same. At the moment I am unable to give a clearer perspective on this. :)

I hope you bring clarity of intent if we connect, and respect your time and mine as we start getting to know each other. I appreciate a straight forward rejection (if that’s the sensible option) over a vague excuse riddled with euphemisms. I can assure you the same from my side.

I suppose there are many more points I could add here — but rather than make this any longer, feel free to connect should whatever you’ve read so far inspire you to do so.

I can assure you I’m better over a call / F2F meeting than on texts.

Lastly, I appreciate you for having gotten so far. And for reading what I had to say. I hope that you find the right companion for this journey called life.

Education was a great leveler for me there onwards as it helped me get rid of poverty. Currently, while raising money I realised there is a class for Ivy league, alumni network and people with generational wealth who do get unfair advantage (might be considered as privilege) in creating more wealth & better shot at opportunities. In my case, I believe freedom to dream (even if those are delusional dreams), aspire (even if your current situation say otherwise), speak your truth (no matter how devastating it is) and still do what you want to do as an individual is true privilege. I am blessed to have this privilege since early childhood (I felt everyone thought the same way until my late 20s)  and it was reassuring when I read (and could relate to) Ralph Waldo Emerson's thoughts on Self reliance & individualism.",(Experiences) shaped up who i am today. ,Never married,No,Between 24-30 Lakhs,"I am an entrepreneur, who is engineer (7 years), turned product person (3 years), turned marketing & sales (last 3-4 years) person throughout my career. I did services business for first 6 years for US & EU market as a solo founder & scaled the team upto 100 employees, during this time built a product company and utterly failed, then again built another product company & shut services business. Currently I am focused on B2B SaaS in retailTech industry, raising money for first time and I see myself building for retailtech at least for next 10-15 years. Post that, I plan to do something in agriculture from engineering point of view rather than being a farmer. I love building things. Parallelly, through my trust I will give my time and resources in education domain 3-5 years from now.","PTU / engineering and then some PGD from upgrad (product management), ignou (psychology,  counselling) snd XLRI (business analytics).",Masters,"- I don't have friends and most of my free time is utilised in hobbies. I am a music/ lyrics person, admirer of cinematography & good theater play and watch a lot of movies & Cinema. I started reading at the age of 25, writing at the age of 26. I write non fiction blogs, quotes and poems. At any time I am learning something new, from the past 3 months I have been swimming. Next year I want to learn drums/ piano. (this is how I learned product management, psychology, philosophy & geopolitics).  
- Whenever I get a chance I travel solo as I go wherever the road takes rather than a planned itinerary. I am looking forward to traveling together if it is something you enjoy too but I don't like/prefer group travel.
- I intend to live in a nuclear family with continuous visits to & from each of our parents and family trips too but least interference in our household affairs. I don't keep up with my extended family & have no intentions to do the same in your case. Though, you can maintain your relationship with them as you desire.
- I don't care about caste, class, religion, income, ex marital status or your age. Only non-negotiable is having children together.  
- I won't jump directly into marriage and may need at least 12-18 months of a relationship.
- I am not a chat/ video call person. My idea of knowing a person is spending time ""in person"" over cooking, traveling, doing activities together, having conversations and so on.
- I quit meat in 2015 (no issue with your dietary choices) and try to be vegan as much as possible, quit drinking in 2017 (no issues, if you are an occasional drinker), quit smoking in 2017 (I can't tolerate smokers from long term health point of view), quit drugs in 2018 (I hope you are not into this). I did have occasional 3-4 times meat, 8-10 drinks during special occasions, 5-7 occasions of baked brownies during travel in the past 7-8 years.
- I have an issue which is stress eating / binge eating which I have been working on for the past couple of years. This is the most stubborn habit I am working on to get rid of. I would say this has been the most challenging aspect of my life for the last 20 plus years.
- I believe I am a calm and patient person with a long term thinking.
- I am apolitical but endorse ideologies like religious pluralism, targeted socialism, capitalism, meritocracy and feminism.  
- I have no diseases (short term or long term)
- I am overweight/ obese (gained majority in the last 3 years due to work stress & lack of sleep). I am losing weight currently. I started at 96.5 in mid April and currently I am at 89 KG losing around 2.5-3 KG per month.
- I have to go all the way till 62-65 KG which is ideal weight for my height of 5""6"". I don't care about your height but I am looking for someone who is active and focused on health.
- I am a truthful, honest and transparent person. You can ask me anything and will always hear an honest answer. I expect there are no mind games and you are as transparent as you can be.
- I believe in unconditional love and romanticism. I see it as a possibility and hope you too see it that way upto certain extent

Teaching Physics for the JEE Advanced to eager young minds is a source of immense fulfillment for me, as I derive great joy from their enthusiastic presence and the opportunity to impart knowledge. The privilege of guiding aspiring students through their academic journey is both a responsibility and a pleasure, fostering a deep sense of satisfaction in witnessing their growth and development.","I spent my formative years in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, where I received my early education at Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyay School until completing my schooling up to Class 12. During this time, I cherished the companionship of my family and friends, whose support and camaraderie enriched my upbringing significantly.  Subsequently, I was admitted to IIT ISM Dhanbad to pursue Petroleum Engineering, a pivotal juncture that not only honed my academic prowess but also afforded me invaluable opportunities beyond the classroom. Apart from delving deep into the realms of petroleum engineering, I immersed myself in the disciplines of martial arts and philosophy. These pursuits not only broadened my horizons but also instilled in me a holistic approach to personal and intellectual growth.  My tenure at IIT ISM Dhanbad was marked by a blend of academic rigor and personal enrichment, where I developed a keen interest in interdisciplinary learning and the application of theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. The experience not only shaped my professional trajectory but also cultivated a deeper understanding of diverse fields, preparing me comprehensively for the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead.",Never married,No,Between 30-35 lakhs,"As an educational professional based in the Delhi NCR region for the past eight years, I have dedicated myself to imparting knowledge and guidance to aspiring students. Specializing in Physics for JEE Mains and Advanced, I am privileged to instruct students in classes 11 and 12, aiming not only to facilitate their success in examinations but also to nurture a broader perspective on life.  My role extends beyond conventional teaching; I endeavor to mentor and empower students, equipping them with the skills and confidence necessary to excel academically and embrace challenges with resilience. By fostering a holistic approach to education, I strive to instill in them a deeper understanding of Physics concepts and encourage critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.  Through my tenure in Delhi NCR, I have remained committed to creating a supportive learning environment that encourages intellectual curiosity and personal growth. It is immensely gratifying to witness my students' progress and development, knowing that I am contributing to their educational journey and preparing them for future endeavors.",IIT ISM Dhanbad,Masters,"I am currently seeking a life partner within the Brahmin community who shares my values and aspirations, with whom I can build a harmonious and fulfilling life together. Compatibility in cultural beliefs and values is important to me, as I envision a future filled with happiness and tranquility.

377,Male,39,Noida,,"‘Privilege for me is having someone to share your life with.’ This statement captures the incredible value of companionship and connection. People very often take companionship for granted, but when we think of it, there are many aspects that tend to get overlooked. For example, when times get tough, you offer each other comfort, understanding, and a sense of security. You both are there to cheer you on during your highs and hold your hand through your lows. Life’s happiest moments are even sweeter when shared. Whether it’s traveling to new places, just laughing over dinner or movie marathons these experiences create beautiful memories that you both cherish.   Privilege is also knowing there’s someone who genuinely cares about you, making life’s journey less lonely and much more enjoyable. When you share your life with someone, they inspire you to grow. They challenge you, offer new perspectives, and help you become a better person. Together, you encourage each other to reach your dreams. Beyond emotional support, having a partner means sharing the load of everyday life. From managing household chores to taking care of each other when sick, you work as a team to handle life’s practicalities.   Having someone to share your life with is a special privilege that makes everything richer and more meaningful. It’s a reminder that relationships and connections are what truly make life worth living.","My initial years were spent in multiple cities and attending various schools.

School was a mixed bag, from being ragged by seniors to becoming the cool kid with the Yamaha RX 100.

It's about living life without constant worry and being able to sleep peacefully - a luxury many can't afford. On a personal level, that's what privilege looks like. More broadly, privilege is not having to constantly prove yourself - your identity, love, or intentions. When you are part of the majority, you don't have to justify yourself, and that's a privilege.

393,Female,41,New Delhi ,,"I define privilege as the presence of deep, meaningful connections in our lives that uplift and support us in our journey. For me, privilege is having a loving and supportive family who understands and encourages my passions. It’s having dependable friends who walk with me through the highs and lows, providing a sense of belonging and joy. It’s also about being blessed with work that I am passionate about, where I can make a positive impact and help others heal and transform their lives. Beyond material wealth, privilege is the ability to align with one’s higher purpose, to live authentically, and to be surrounded by love, growth, and genuine connections.","My growing up years were a blend of beautiful memories and significant challenges, both of which have shaped me into the person I am today. My grandparents hailed from Sindh, Pakistan and started over again in India post partition. I am a native to Pune and my childhood was filled with moments of laughter, play, and deep connections with friends who I, unfortunately, left behind as we moved places. Back then, we weren’t big on social media or tech, so those connections faded over time. However, I cherish the memories of carefree days spent in the warmth of community relationships, as I lived most of those years in a colony full of relatives 😀, some of whom I remain close to today. Growing up in a joint family setup, I faced my share of obstacles, both within myself and in the world around me. These experiences, though difficult, led me to a path of self-discovery and healing. I learned to embrace the lessons of my past, transforming them into strengths that guide me today in helping others through their own challenges.In essence, my growing up years were a journey of love, growth, and finding my true self. They have instilled in me a deep appreciation for the simple joys of life, the strength of enduring relationships, and the power of inner transformation. I would say that my Badi Mumma (paternal grandmother) was a definitive influence in my growing years, and it’s her principles and wisdom passed on to me that have shaped me into the woman I am today.","Was married earlier, legally divorced",No,Under 12 Lakhs,"I bring 15+ years of experience as a media professional, content writer, communications specialist, and corporate communication professional. After a fulfilling corporate career, I gracefully hung up my corporate boots in 2018 to pursue my heart's calling (got intrigued by the energy world after an Out of Body Experience in Pondicherry Matrimandir and started learning about alternate healing modalities and got certified alongside my corporate career).   Before stepping into the healing space, I wanted to empty myself - so enlisted for Vipassana and decided to give back to society. So I embraced a new path by joining the prestigious Teach for India fellowship. During this time, I had the honor of teaching children from vulnerable communities, where I not only imparted knowledge in math and English but also introduced mindfulness practices that deeply impacted their lives.  Following this transformative experience, I transitioned into my current role as a Holistic Healing Practitioner, Tarot Consultant, and Inner Harmony Coach.

403,Male,36,Hyderabad,,"Life is incredibly complex, with countless variables. Limiting the definition of ‘privilege’ to just a few factors doesn’t make sense to me.  A few years ago, while traveling with fellow backpackers, I met two Israeli girls. They were sharing the journey with me in a foreign country but would soon return to their homeland, a place of constant unrest, terror attacks, and uncertainty. Being born and living in a community with security and peace felt like a huge privilege to me. Two months ago, I saw a little girl, no more than two years old, recovering from surgery for a tumor. She was bravely fighting her way through it in the ICU. Health and courage seemed like the ultimate privileges to me. Every time I run a fundraising campaign to support a child’s education, the fact that their future depends on the kindness of a random stranger makes basic financial stability seem like a privilege to me.  I’m a thinker, so the list could go on. But I’ll leave it at that. :) Personally, the things I am most grateful for as privileges are having an amazing, loving, and supportive family and friends.","Haha, this will be fun!
